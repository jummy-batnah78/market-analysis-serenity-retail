This project focuses on segmenting Serenity Retail’s customers by analyzing demographics, purchasing behavior, and psychographics to tailor marketing strategies. By categorizing customers into distinct segments, the project uncovers patterns such as spending habits across income levels, shopping channel preferences by gender, and product choices linked to lifestyle.
Key insights reveal that personalized campaigns—aligned with these preferences—can significantly enhance customer engagement, loyalty, and profitability.
The analysis also identifies gaps in data granularity, which may impact the precision of certain insights, highlighting areas for future data collection and refinement.The project aims to segment Serenity Retail’s diverse customer base to improve the precision and effectiveness of its marketing strategies. By analyzing data on demographics (e.g., age, income, location), purchasing behavior (e.g., spending scores, preferred shopping channels), and psychographics (e.g., lifestyle preferences, brand loyalty), the project seeks to uncover unique customer profiles. These profiles reveal insights into how different groups interact with the brand: for instance, higher-income customers may lean toward premium products online, while lower-income groups prefer essential purchases in-store.

Using tools like Power BI, the project visualizes key relationships, such as the impact of gender and marital status on annual spending, and how homeownership status influences purchasing decisions. This analysis guides the development of tailored campaigns and product offerings that match each segment's needs and preferences, aiming to enhance customer satisfaction, loyalty, and overall profitability.

Challenges include limited psychographic data, a static dataset that may not capture seasonal trends, and a lack of granularity in occupation data, which may restrict the depth of the insights. These constraints highlight areas where additional data collection or periodic updates could support more refined targeting in future analyses.
